== Description ==
EU Cookie Compliance displays a banner to new visitors telling them about your sites use of cookies and either taking their implied consent or requiring their acceptance based on your preference.
The banner is a section and as such can be moved around your page and placed exactly where you want it. After a user has accepted (or seen it once) the banner will disappear only to be seen again in a years time (to allow your visitors to reconsider).

=== Options ===
* Define whether to use required or implied acceptance
* Change the banner text
* Place it where you want on your page
* Make the banner stay static on the top or bottom of the screenw ith new float options.

This section is designed only to *help you meet EU regulations* and *does not ensure you are compliant* (please see <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx">ICO</a> for more details). Each site has different requirements based on what they store in cookies and you will need to have a page explaining the implications of cookies in more detail.

=== Planned improvements ===
(if your setup requires these please only buy the section when they are included. In the meantime send me an email to let me knows its important!)
* Display Banner only to EU visitors
